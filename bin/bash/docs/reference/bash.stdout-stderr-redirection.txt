>& : (per POSIX spec) when surrounded by digits (1>&2) or - on the right side (1>&-) either redirects only one file descriptor or closes it (>&-).

A >& followed by a file descriptor number is a portable way to redirect a file descriptor, and >&- is a portable way to close a file descriptor.

If the right side of this redirection is a file please read the next entry.

>&, &>, >>& and &>> : (read above also) Redirect both standard error and standard output, replacing or appending, respectively.

command &> out.txt

Both standard error and standard output of command will be saved in out.txt, overwriting its contents or creating it if it doesn't exist.

command &>> out.txt

As above, except that if out.txt exists, the output and error of command will be appended to it.

The &> variant originates in bash, while the >& variant comes from csh (decades earlier). They both conflict with other POSIX shell operators and should not be used in portable sh scripts.
